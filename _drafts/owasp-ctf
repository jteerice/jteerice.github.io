title: STL OWASP QUARANTINE CTF
---

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a type of computer security competition usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in analyzing and exploiting security flaws. To give people more to do indoors, [Chris Elbring](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-elbring-jr-2a255968/) and I developed the fully remote QUARANTINE CTF hosted by [STL OWASP](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-STL/events/268671040/). The competition included 58 challenges across 6 canonical categories and lasted from Tuesday, April 14, 2020, 7:00 PM to Tuesday, April 28, 2020, 7:00 PM CDT.

Chris hosted the CTF across a few load-balanced AWS EC2 instances. We had a great turnout and every challenged was solved by at least one person.
