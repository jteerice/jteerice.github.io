The Sassy Death of the Moat and Castle

* Traditional Holes (Controls) and What Breaks Them (also, OLD!)
  * Firewall - Management; Complex Rules; Legacy Services
  * VPN - Split Tunneling
  * DLP - MTA/SEG
  * DNS - Cloud Services; Poisoning
  * Directory Services (AD, LDAP) - Hybrid Environments
  * Identity (IAM) - SSO; Legacy System; Containers; Certificates
  * Agents (AV) - Mobile; Zero Day; non-Windows OS; capacity
  * Proxies (SWG) - managing the Cloud; allowing Cloud Services
  * NAT (Private Networks) - Hybrid Environments

NIST is extremely valuable, but the language implies a moat and castle.
* NIST 800-12rl Section 2.6
  * system life cycle
  * policies, procedures
  * intrusion detection systems, firewalls, configuration settings, and AV
  * gates, guards
  * system assets

* Time to get SASE!
  * According to Gartner, “SASE capabilities are delivered as a service based upon the identity of the entity, real-time context, enterprise security/compliance policies and continuous assessment of risk/trust throughout the sessions. Identities of entities can be associated with people, groups of people (branch offices), devices, applications, services, IoT systems or edge computing locations.”
