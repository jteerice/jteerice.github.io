After submitting feedback, we see in the customer feedback section of the /administration site that the comments made by admin are signified by User 1. We also see the first review seems to be a fake one written by the admin. Following the email chart, we assume User 2 is jim (jim@juice-sh.op). From the Recycling Requests table, we learn his address is Starfleet HQ so this jim may in fact be James Tiberius Kirk. From a quick wiki search, we learn James has a brother named George Samuel Kirk. We enter Samuel into the Forgot Password recovery question "Your eldest siblings middle name?", and set a new password "pass1".
