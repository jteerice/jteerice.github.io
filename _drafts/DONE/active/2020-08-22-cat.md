title: HackTheBox - Cat
---

Cat is a mobile challenge on HackTheBox. First, download the zip file and open it using the supplied password `hackthebox`. Then use the following command to unpack the Android image (which is an Android Backup file):

```
( printf "\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" ; tail -c +25 backup.ab ) |  tar xfvz -
```
This dumps an apps and a shared folder. In `/shared/0` we find a home directory with the following folders: Alarms, Download, Music, Pictures, Ringtones, DCIM, MOVIES, Notifications, Podcasts. With a simple `find` command, we see that the only folder with any files in it is Pictures. Going through all the pictures with `eog`, IMAG0004.jpg sticks out since it's not a cat picture. We find the flag printed at the bottom of the clipboard upon zooming in.
