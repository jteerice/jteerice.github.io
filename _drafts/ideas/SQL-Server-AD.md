title: Webinar - SQL Server Hacking Tips for Active Directory Environments
---

> Presented by Scott Sutherland @ NetSPI

## Description

Join us for our second webinar in our Lunch & Learn Series! Where there is Active Directory, there are SQL Servers. In dynamic enterprise environments, itâ€™s common to see both platforms suffer from misconfigurations that lead to unauthorized system and sensitive data access. During this presentation, Scott will cover common ways to target, exploit, and escalate domain privileges through SQL Servers in Active Directory environments. He will also share a msbuild.exe project file that can be used as an offensive SQL Client during red team engagements when tools like PowerUpSQL are too overt.
