title: CTF - Cybersecurity Converge Tour @ UMSL
---

Some members of the WUSTL CTF club [b34r$hell](https://wustl-bearshell.github.io/) drove out to UMSL to attend the Cybersecurity Converge Tour. The tour consisted of a Career Pathways Discussion, exercises around resolving ransomware, Capture the Flag, and lunch. I found the ```cyberseek.org``` Career Pathway map that they presented to be a great reference. We had two teams and placed 2nd and 3rd.
