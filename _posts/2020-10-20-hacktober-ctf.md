## Selected Solutions

### Talking to the Dead I-IV

```


### Prefetch Perfection
> Prefetch files are another handy tool to show evidence of execution. What time was Internet Explorer opened? (GMT) Submit the flag as flag{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}.

I downloaded WinPrefetchView and in Advanced Options changed the Prefetch Folder to the challenge folder. There was one row for IEXPLORE.EXE and two rows for IE4UINIT.EXE. In the options, switch to GMT time and grab the last run date: `5/1/2017 9:11:41 PM`. Put that into the correct format: `flag{2017-05-01 21:11:41}`.


### Past Attacks
> Knowing that it is going to be an attack against a Financial firm. What is the type of attack that is likely to happen? Enter the answer as flag{word word}.

I tried a bunch of guesses until finally landing on `flag{watering hole}`.
```
flag{data exfiltration}
flag{eternal blue}
flag{social engineering}
flag{ddos attack}
flag{ddos attacks}
flag{credential stuffing}
flag{phishing attack}
flag{ransomware attack}
flag{insider threat}
flag{insider threats}
flag{data breach}
flag{data loss}
flag{banking malware}
flag{banking trojan}
flag{insider attack}
flag{insider attacks}
flag{accidental disclosures}
flag{mega breach}
flag{whaling attack}
flag{watering hole}
```
## Evil Corp's Child 2

> The malware uses four different ip addresses and ports for communication, what IP uses the same port as https? Submit the flag as: flag{ip address}.

Unzip the file with the password `hacktober`.

Filter on: `tcp.port == 443 || udp.port == 443`

`192.168.1.91` which downloaded the malware communicates with `213.136.94.177` over port 443.

`flag{213.136.94.177}`

## Evil Corp's Child 3

> What is the localityName in the Certificate Issuer data for HTTPS traffic to 37.205.9.252?

Filter on: `ip.addr == 37.205.9.252` and search for `localityName` in the packet details. You can find it in frame 521.

```
Certificate: 3082037f30820267a003020102020900d7b06c4ce1fe0221â€¦ (id-at-commonName=Inawe0deouna.pics,id-at-organizationName=Bulloccea B.M.,id-at-localityName=Mogadishu,id-at-countryName=SO)
```

`flag{Mogadishu}`

### Remotely Administrated Evil 2

> What MYDDNS domain is used for the post-infection traffic in RATPack.pcap?

Just search for MYDDNS in the packet details. Frame 1497 contains the string: `solution.myddns.me: type A, class IN`

`flag{solution.myddns.me}`

Name: global.asimov.events.data.trafficmanager.net


### An Evil Christmas Carol 2

> What is the domain used by the post-infection traffic over HTTPS?

Filter on: `dns && ip.addr == 10.0.0.163`. Out of all the domains, vlcafxbdjtlvlcduwhga.com stands out.

`flag{vlcafxbdjtlvlcduwhga.com}`


### Red Rum

> We want you to infiltrate DEADFACE as a programmer. Thing is, they're picky about who they bring in. They want to make sure you're the real deal when it comes to programming. Generate a list of numbers 1-500. For each number divisible by 3, replace it with Red; for each number divisible by 5, replace it with Rum. For numbers divisible by both 3 AND 5, replace it with RedRum.
> nc env2.hacktober.io 5000

When you try to connect, you get the following output:
```
$ nc env2.hacktober.io 5000
DEADFACE gatekeeper: If you want to join our programmers circle, you need to show that you can at least do the basics. Send the first 500 (1 - 500) Red Rums to show you're serious. You answer should be comma-separated with no spaces.
```

This appeared to be a simple FizzBuzz challenge that didn't even require a pwntools connection to send and recieve lines. My teammate wrote a script that generated the string we needed:
```
1,2,Red,4,Rum,Red,7,8,Red,Rum,11,Red,13,14,RedRum,Red,16,17,Red,19,Rum,Red,22,23,Red,Rum,26,Red,28,29,RedRum,Red,31,32,Red,34,Rum,Red,37,38,Red,Rum,41,Red,43,44,RedRum,Red,46,47,Red,49,Rum,Red,52,53,Red,Rum,56,Red,58,59,RedRum,Red,61,62,Red,64,Rum,Red,67,68,Red,Rum,71,Red,73,74,RedRum,Red,76,77,Red,79,Rum,Red,82,83,Red,Rum,86,Red,88,89,RedRum,Red,91,92,Red,94,Rum,Red,97,98,Red,Rum,101,Red,103,104,RedRum,Red,106,107,Red,109,Rum,Red,112,113,Red,Rum,116,Red,118,119,RedRum,Red,121,122,Red,124,Rum,Red,127,128,Red,Rum,131,Red,133,134,RedRum,Red,136,137,Red,139,Rum,Red,142,143,Red,Rum,146,Red,148,149,RedRum,Red,151,152,Red,154,Rum,Red,157,158,Red,Rum,161,Red,163,164,RedRum,Red,166,167,Red,169,Rum,Red,172,173,Red,Rum,176,Red,178,179,RedRum,Red,181,182,Red,184,Rum,Red,187,188,Red,Rum,191,Red,193,194,RedRum,Red,196,197,Red,199,Rum,Red,202,203,Red,Rum,206,Red,208,209,RedRum,Red,211,212,Red,214,Rum,Red,217,218,Red,Rum,221,Red,223,224,RedRum,Red,226,227,Red,229,Rum,Red,232,233,Red,Rum,236,Red,238,239,RedRum,Red,241,242,Red,244,Rum,Red,247,248,Red,Rum,251,Red,253,254,RedRum,Red,256,257,Red,259,Rum,Red,262,263,Red,Rum,266,Red,268,269,RedRum,Red,271,272,Red,274,Rum,Red,277,278,Red,Rum,281,Red,283,284,RedRum,Red,286,287,Red,289,Rum,Red,292,293,Red,Rum,296,Red,298,299,RedRum,Red,301,302,Red,304,Rum,Red,307,308,Red,Rum,311,Red,313,314,RedRum,Red,316,317,Red,319,Rum,Red,322,323,Red,Rum,326,Red,328,329,RedRum,Red,331,332,Red,334,Rum,Red,337,338,Red,Rum,341,Red,343,344,RedRum,Red,346,347,Red,349,Rum,Red,352,353,Red,Rum,356,Red,358,359,RedRum,Red,361,362,Red,364,Rum,Red,367,368,Red,Rum,371,Red,373,374,RedRum,Red,376,377,Red,379,Rum,Red,382,383,Red,Rum,386,Red,388,389,RedRum,Red,391,392,Red,394,Rum,Red,397,398,Red,Rum,401,Red,403,404,RedRum,Red,406,407,Red,409,Rum,Red,412,413,Red,Rum,416,Red,418,419,RedRum,Red,421,422,Red,424,Rum,Red,427,428,Red,Rum,431,Red,433,434,RedRum,Red,436,437,Red,439,Rum,Red,442,443,Red,Rum,446,Red,448,449,RedRum,Red,451,452,Red,454,Rum,Red,457,458,Red,Rum,461,Red,463,464,RedRum,Red,466,467,Red,469,Rum,Red,472,473,Red,Rum,476,Red,478,479,RedRum,Red,481,482,Red,484,Rum,Red,487,488,Red,Rum,491,Red,493,494,RedRum,Red,496,497,Red,499,Rum
```
While the string was confirmed correct by the CTF admin, every attempt to send it over the line resulted in a closed connection usually with the string `Stop wasting my time.`. I tried piping it into `netcat` from a file, `echo`ing it with and without the trailing newline character, and sending it using the pwn library in a python script.

On a whim, I decided to scan the port and lo and behold I was gifted the flag.
