title: Autopsy Digital Forensics Certificate
---

Digital forensics first came on my radar in CTF competitions. Though I find those challenges fun, I quickly came to learn that they are not quite representative of real world digital forensics, usually done by law enforcement. I heard that there was a digital forensics course being offered for free due to the lockdown, and I signed up to add breadth to my security knowledge and to hopefully give myself another tool for CTFs. The Autopsy Basics and Hands On (8-hour) course provided training to conduct digital forensics investigations with hands-on labs analyzing laptop and media card disk images to solve a dognapping case.
