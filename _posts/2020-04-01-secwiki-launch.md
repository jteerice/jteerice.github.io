title: SecWiki Launch

I keep a lot of notes on the topics, tools, and challenges I come across in my exploration of cybersecurity. Up until now, I've been keeping my notes across a few increasingly bloated CherryTree files. I have started to move everything to a GitBook to be a living resource for myself and whomever is interested. You can find my security-focused, public, personal wiki at [wiki.zacheller.dev](https://wiki.zacheller.dev). If you have any corrections or additions, send me an email.
