## Crackmes.one: Simple Keygen - Write-up

This is a linux crackme by Yuri.

### The Main Function

This is one of the few crackmes where I might try and start with dynamic analysis instead of static analysis. The main function is simple, but the two variables allocatedon the stack are initialized with the values of ```edi``` and ```rsi```, which are only known at run time.
```asm
; int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
public main
main proc near

var_10= qword ptr -10h
var_4= dword ptr -4

; __unwind {
push    rbp
mov     rbp, rsp
sub     rsp, 10h
mov     [rbp+var_4], edi
mov     [rbp+var_10], rsi
cmp     [rbp+var_4], 2
jz      short loc_124A
```

##### Dynamic Analysis of the Main Function

Let's fire up gdb and see what we can find. If we set a breakpoint at ```main```, we can get the memory address for the instruction we want to break at and inspect ```edi``` and ```esi```.
```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── code:x86:64 ────
   0x555555555225 <checkSerial+142> ret    
   0x555555555226 <main+0>         push   rbp
   0x555555555227 <main+1>         mov    rbp, rsp
 → 0x55555555522a <main+4>         sub    rsp, 0x10
   0x55555555522e <main+8>         mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4], edi
   0x555555555231 <main+11>        mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10], rsi
   0x555555555235 <main+15>        cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4], 0x2
   0x555555555239 <main+19>        je     0x55555555524a <main+36>
   0x55555555523b <main+21>        mov    rax, QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── threads ────

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── trace ────
[#0] 0x55555555522a → main()
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
gef➤  
```

We can see that the memory address we want to set a breakpoint at is the ```cmp``` instruction immediately following the ```mov``` instructions. If we continue to our breakpoint, we can use ```info registers``` to see what the registers hold.
```
gef➤  info registers
rax            0x555555555226      0x555555555226
rbx            0x7fffffffdef8      0x7fffffffdef8
rcx            0x7ffff7fa1820      0x7ffff7fa1820
rdx            0x7fffffffdf08      0x7fffffffdf08
rsi            0x7fffffffdef8      0x7fffffffdef8
rdi            0x1                 0x1
```

So it looks like ```rsi``` holds ```0x7fffffffdef8``` and ```rdi``` holds ```0x1```. Further in main we see that the value of ```rdi``` is being compared to the value ```2``` before the program can continue. I think it is safe to assume that this is a strange stack allocated version of ```argc```. 

Let's try and run the program again but with an argument and see if we can get ```rdi``` to hold ```0x2```.
```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
gef➤  info registers
rax            0x555555555226      0x555555555226
rbx            0x7fffffffdee8      0x7fffffffdee8
rcx            0x7ffff7fa1820      0x7ffff7fa1820
rdx            0x7fffffffdf00      0x7fffffffdf00
rsi            0x7fffffffdee8      0x7fffffffdee8
rdi            0x2                 0x2
```

Perfect. Onto the next section!

##### The Serial

The next instruction set simply adds ```8``` to the value of ```rsi``` and calls a function called ```checkserial```. The value returned by ```checkserial``` must be ```0``` or the program will fail.
```asm
mov     rax, [rbp+rsi_value]
add     rax, 8
mov     rax, [rax]
mov     rdi, rax
call    checkSerial
test    eax, eax
jnz     short loc_1274
```

### checkserial

The function starts by moving the value at ```rdi``` (which is the argument we passed to the program) into the variable ```s```. Then it calls ```strlen``` and checks to ensure that the argument is 16 characters long.
```asm
public checkSerial
checkSerial proc near

s= qword ptr -28h
var_14= dword ptr -14h

; __unwind {
push    rbp
mov     rbp, rsp
push    rbx
sub     rsp, 28h
mov     [rbp+s], rdi
mov     rax, [rbp+s]
mov     rdi, rax        ; s
call    _strlen
cmp     rax, 16
jz      short loc_11BD
```

Next, the value ```0``` is moved into variable ```var_14```. This looks like it is shaping up to be a loop!

###### The Loop

First, the program checks to ensure that the ```counter``` variable is less than the length of the argument we passed in. 
```asm
mov     eax, [rbp+counter]
movsxd  rbx, eax
mov     rax, [rbp+argument]
mov     rdi, rax        ; s
call    _strlen
cmp     rbx, rax
jb      short loc_11C6
```
Looking a little further in the assembly, we see that every iteration of the loop adds ```2``` to the counter. We could imply that the c code that represents this loop may start with a ```while``` loop like so:
```c
counter = 0;

while (counter < strlen(argument) {
	// do some sort of comparison to avoid exiting the loop early
	counter += 2;
}
```
If the while loop completes without terminating early due to a condition we are about to decipher, the function will return 0 and we will have cracked the challenge.

##### The Hard Part

Now we see the crux of the challenge. The ```counter``` is moved into the ```eax``` register and is sign extended/moved into the ```rdx``` register. Then, we see that the value of ```counter``` is added to ```rax``` which is essentially an offset in the form of ```argument[counter]```. The ```counter``` is now moved back into ```eax``` and has ```1``` added to it, gets sign extended into rax, and is computed as another offset for the ```argument``` variable. 

Finally, the two offsets are subtracted and compared to the difference between the two is ```0xFFFFFFFF```. We can assume, since we are dealing with the ```char``` data type, that the value of ```0xFFFFFFFF``` is ```-1``` and not ```4294967295```. For more information on what this is, check out this [guide](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html).

```asm
mov     eax, [rbp+counter]
movsxd  rdx, eax
mov     rax, [rbp+argument]
add     rax, rdx
movzx   eax, byte ptr [rax]
movsx   edx, al
mov     eax, [rbp+counter]
cdqe
lea     rcx, [rax+1]
mov     rax, [rbp+argument]
add     rax, rcx
movzx   eax, byte ptr [rax]
movsx   eax, al
sub     edx, eax
mov     eax, edx
cmp     eax, 0FFFFFFFFh
jz      short loc_11FF
```
###### Cracking checkSerial

So, what do we know?

We know the key needs to be 16 characters long and that the value of each character must be ```1``` less than the character after it. Let's write a python script.
```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from random import randint

starter = randint(33, 110)
serial = ""
serial += chr(starter)

for i in range(15):
   serial += chr(ord(serial[i]) + 1)

print(serial)
```

Let's run the output and see how we did.
```
└─$ ./SimpleKeyGen JKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY
Good Serial
```

Et Voila!
