## What information can you possible get starting with just one photo?

### Steganography
We start by downloading the WindowsXP.jpg screensaver.

The most obvious thing to check is the handle in the copyright. Once that is exhausted, we can check the GPS position.

> Copyright                       : OWoodflint
> GPS Position                    : 54 deg 17' 41.27" N, 2 deg 15' 1.33" W

### Twitter

> Twitter handle: @OWoodflint
> Likes taking photos
> Likes open source projects
> Likes cats

I downloaded the profile picture as well, but exiftool turned up nothing interesting.

### Github

### Wordpress Blog
Through google, we stumble across a blog:

> https://oliverwoodflint.wordpress.com/author/owoodflint/

![Wordpress](/images/thm/OhSINT/4.png)

> Full Name: Oliver Woodflint
> In New York on Holiday on 3rd March 2019

We also find a password hidden with white coloration in the one blog post. This was a very odd place to find a password.

### Coordinates

Now we return back to the coordinates of the photo:
> 54 deg 17' 41.27" N, 2 deg 15' 1.33" W

Using ```findlatitudeandlongitude.com```, we can get coordinates: 
```
Latitude: 54.294797°
Longitude:  -2.250369°
```

Using the BSSID from the twitter post, we can look up the network on ```Wigle.net```.
