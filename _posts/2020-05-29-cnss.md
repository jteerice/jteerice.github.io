title: CNSS Certified Network Security Specialist
---

The International Cybersecurity Institute ([ICSI](https://www.icsi.co.uk/)) had an free offer on their Certified Network Security Specialist [course](https://www.icsi.co.uk/courses/icsi-cnss-certified-network-security-specialist-covid-19) due to COVID, so I thought I'd take advantage. I finished the course in about a week and took a bunch of notes which you can find on [SecWiki](https://wiki.zacheller.dev/network-security/isci-cnss-course).

My certificate of completion can be found [here](https://www.credential.net/6c3b5221-26dc-4fa6-9bb6-be4721e52b8c#gs.d7d6vt).
