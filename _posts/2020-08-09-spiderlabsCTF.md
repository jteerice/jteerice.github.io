title: CTF - SpiderLabs @ Blackhat 2020
---

My team B34R5H3LL-RED competed in the SpiderLabs CTF at Virtual Blackhat from Thursday, August 6 at 6:00 pm PST to August 8 at 6:00 pm PST. We started with an early lead and kept 1st place for the first 8 or so hours. We ended with 1350 points in 39th place out of over 500 teams, and each member of the team won a neat SpiderLabs t-shirt. There were a lot of very difficult challenges and inconsistent flag-naming conventions, but it was still a lot of fun. I learned a lot about SSO, HMAC, the Brainfuck esolang, THREE FIRST NATIONAL PLAZA, the [RingZer0 team](https://ringzer0ctf.com/), Cortex XDR, and Software Defined Radio.
