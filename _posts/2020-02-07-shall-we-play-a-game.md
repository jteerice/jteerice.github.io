title: Workshop - Shall we play a game?
---

On Friday, February 7, I ran a [workshop](https://www.meetup.com/St-Louis-2600/events/skcdpnybcdbkb/) for STL 2600 at Arch Reactor. I conducted a guided walkthrough of OverTheWire's Bandit, a CTF game designed to teach the essential skills for competing in more advanced CTF games. We went through the challenges as a group and played Bash golf with our individual solutions.
