title: RE&#58; Grayhat 2020

I had a great time at Grayhat this year. There were a lot of competitions, and it was hard to choose where I wanted to spend my time. See the entire list here:

I ended up winning the Niflheim's Network CTF, getting root on the SECARMY OSCP Giveaway Vulnhub box, learning some cool tunneling and pivoting techniques from the Red Team Village CTF, enjoying the CyberWraith game, and messing around on the Cyber Weapons Range. Thanks to everyone that had a hand in running Grayhat and its competitions!
