## Newspaper

## Multiplication Table and Imprint
Mr. Robot responds to Dark Army's request in the newspaper about status of backdoor implementation through Leon. Elliot mentions waking up to Mr. Robot doing a bunch of multiplication tables on the May 26th entry and later Mr. Robot taking the journal from him. After that on the same day, Leon talks to a Dark Army agent and likely relays the coded message.
