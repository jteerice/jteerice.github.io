title: Niflheim Network CTF @ Grayhat 2020
---

Niflheim's Network was a free threat hunting CTF provided to those attending Grayhat 2020, hosted at [niflheimsnetwork.duckdns.org](https://niflheimsnetwork.duckdns.org/). I took 1st place with 47 challenges solved and 3506 points scored. The event went smoothly, the challenges were interesting, the data wrangling was good practice, and I learned a lot in general. I appreciate the CTF moderators/creators for being so responsive. Thanks again!
