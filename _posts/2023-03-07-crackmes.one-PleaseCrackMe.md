### Main Function

There isn't too much to this challenge. It consists of one main function that in which user input is read in and must pass a check.

```asm
.text:00000000000011E9 ; int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
.text:00000000000011E9                 public main
.text:00000000000011E9 main            proc near               ; DATA XREF: _start+21↑o
.text:00000000000011E9
.text:00000000000011E9 var_78          = dword ptr -78h
.text:00000000000011E9 var_74          = dword ptr -74h
.text:00000000000011E9 s               = byte ptr -70h
.text:00000000000011E9 s1              = byte ptr -50h
.text:00000000000011E9 s2              = byte ptr -30h
.text:00000000000011E9 var_18          = qword ptr -18h
.text:00000000000011E9
.text:00000000000011E9 ; __unwind {
.text:00000000000011E9                 endbr64
.text:00000000000011ED                 push    rbp
.text:00000000000011EE                 mov     rbp, rsp
.text:00000000000011F1                 push    rbx
.text:00000000000011F2                 sub     rsp, 78h
.text:00000000000011F6                 mov     rax, fs:28h
.text:00000000000011FF                 mov     [rbp+var_18], rax
.text:0000000000001203                 xor     eax, eax
.text:0000000000001205                 lea     rdi, format     ; "Type in your Username: "
.text:000000000000120C                 mov     eax, 0
.text:0000000000001211                 call    _printf
.text:0000000000001216                 lea     rax, [rbp+s]
.text:000000000000121A                 mov     rsi, rax
.text:000000000000121D                 lea     rdi, aS         ; "%s"
.text:0000000000001224                 mov     eax, 0
.text:0000000000001229                 call    ___isoc99_scanf
.text:000000000000122E                 lea     rdi, aTypeInANumberB ; "\nType in a number beetween 1 and 9: "
.text:0000000000001235                 mov     eax, 0
.text:000000000000123A                 call    _printf
.text:000000000000123F                 lea     rax, [rbp+var_78]
.text:0000000000001243                 mov     rsi, rax
.text:0000000000001246                 lea     rdi, aD         ; "%d"
.text:000000000000124D                 mov     eax, 0
.text:0000000000001252                 call    ___isoc99_scanf
.text:0000000000001257                 mov     eax, [rbp+var_78]

.text:000000000000125A                 test    eax, eax
.text:000000000000125C                 jg      short loc_1274
.text:000000000000125E                 lea     rdi, s          ; "\nError: Number is too small"
.text:0000000000001265                 call    _puts
.text:000000000000126A                 mov     eax, 0FFFFFFFFh
.text:000000000000126F                 jmp     loc_1331
```

We have quite a few variables allocated on the stack and no variables pass as arguments. After the function preamble, the value ```28h``` is moved into ```var_18```.
```asm
.text:00000000000011F6                 mov     rax, fs:28h
.text:00000000000011FF                 mov     [rbp+var_18], rax
```

It is safe to assume that this is a the value being used as the buffer length for the strings that will be accepted as user input. We can rename the variable accordingly.

Next, a ```printf``` function is called asking the user to input a username. Then the address of variable ```s``` is moved into rax, presumably to be read into by the following ```scanf``` function.
```asm
.text:0000000000001205                 lea     rdi, format     ; "Type in your Username: "
.text:000000000000120C                 mov     eax, 0
.text:0000000000001211                 call    _printf
.text:0000000000001216                 lea     rax, [rbp+s]
.text:000000000000121A                 mov     rsi, rax
.text:000000000000121D                 lea     rdi, aS         ; "%s"
.text:0000000000001224                 mov     eax, 0
.text:0000000000001229                 call    ___isoc99_scanf
```

Now the program moves the ```var_78``` variable to rax to have a number between 1 and 9 read into it by the user.
```asm
.text:000000000000122E                 lea     rdi, aTypeInANumberB ; "\nType in a number beetween 1 and 9: "
.text:0000000000001235                 mov     eax, 0
.text:000000000000123A                 call    _printf
.text:000000000000123F                 lea     rax, [rbp+var_78]
.text:0000000000001243                 mov     rsi, rax
.text:0000000000001246                 lea     rdi, aD         ; "%d"
.text:000000000000124D                 mov     eax, 0
.text:0000000000001252                 call    ___isoc99_scanf
```

The number read into ```var_78``` is checked to ensure it is not 0, then the function proceeds to a jmp instruction.
```asm
.text:0000000000001257                 mov     eax, [rbp+number]
.text:000000000000125A                 test    eax, eax
.text:000000000000125C                 jg      short loc_1274
```

The number read into ```var_78``` is then checked to ensure it is less than or equal to 9.
```asm
.text:0000000000001274                 mov     eax, [rbp+number]
.text:0000000000001277                 cmp     eax, 9
.text:000000000000127A                 jle     short loc_1292
.text:000000000000127C                 lea     rdi, aErrorNumberIsT_0 ; "\nError: Number is too big"
.text:0000000000001283                 call    _puts
.text:0000000000001288                 mov     eax, 0FFFFFFFFh
.text:000000000000128D                 jmp     loc_1331
```
### The Loop

The next chunk of code is fairly interesting. The value ```0``` is read into the variable ```var_74```.
```asm
.text:0000000000001292                 mov     [rbp+var_74], 0
.text:0000000000001299                 jmp     short loc_12BB
```

Then, the value read into ```var_74``` is compared against the length of the ```username``` variable. If ```var_74``` is less than the length of ```username```, the function proceeds to what I can assume is some kind of encryption function. We can rename the ```var_74``` function to ```counter``` for a more descriptive reference.
```asm
.text:00000000000012BB                 mov     eax, [rbp+var_74]
.text:00000000000012BE                 movsxd  rbx, eax
.text:00000000000012C1                 lea     rax, [rbp+username]
.text:00000000000012C5                 mov     rdi, rax        ; s
.text:00000000000012C8                 call    _strlen
.text:00000000000012CD                 cmp     rbx, rax
.text:00000000000012D0                 jb      short loc_129B
```

The ```counter``` variable is read into EAX and the ```cdqe``` instruction is invoked. This instruction sign extends a 32-bit value in the EAX register to a 64-bit value in the RAX register.
```asm
.text:000000000000129B                 mov     eax, [rbp+counter]
.text:000000000000129E                 cdqe
```

The next chunk of instructions is the meat and potatoes of this challenge. The value at ```[rbp+rax+username]``` is read into EDX. The value in RAX that is being added to the value of rbp+username is an offset for the character array of ```username```. Essentially, this is the same as ```username[counter]```.

Next, the ```number``` variable the user provided earlier in the program is added to the decimal value of ```username[counter]```. The value of ```username[counter] + number``` is then moved into the variable ```s1``` offset by the same ```counter``` variable. This looks like another character array that will serve as the encrypted version of the username we provided.

To finish it off, the ```counter``` variable is incremented by ```1``` and the loop is repeated.
```asm
mov     eax, [rbp+counter]
cdqe
movzx   eax, [rbp+rax+username]
mov     edx, eax
mov     eax, [rbp+number]
add     eax, edx
mov     edx, eax
mov     eax, [rbp+counter]
cdqe
mov     [rbp+rax+s1], dl
add     [rbp+counter], 1
```

Once the loop completes, the user is prompted for the password. The password is read into the variable ```s2``` and is compared against the value of the encrypted username. If the two strings match, we pass the check.

### Cracking the Program

To crack this program, we need to provide a username, a number which will serve as the encryption key, and then provide password which is the same as the encrypted username. Let's write a python script.
```python
#!/usr/bin/python

username = "crackme"
key = 5
encryptedUsername = ""

for letter in username:
    encryptedUsername += chr(ord(letter) + key)

print(encryptedUsername)
```

If we run the script, we are provided with the string ```hwfhprj```. Let's run it and see if we are successful.
```
└─$ ./PleaseCrackMe 
Type in your Username: crackme

Type in a number beetween 1 and 9: 5

Type in the password: hwfhprj

You are succesfully logged in
```

Et Voila!
