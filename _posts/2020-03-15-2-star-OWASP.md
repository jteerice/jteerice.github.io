## Classic Stored XSS
### Perform an XSS attack with ```<script>alert(`xss`)</script>``` on a legacy page within the application.

In the Architecture overview, we are told Angular is used to create a so-called *Single Page Application*. But, the profile page looks subtly odd and dated compared with the other screens. You can update an account's username with a field, which is susceptible to XSS.

Entering ```<script>alert(`xss`)</script>```, our username gets set to ```\lert(`xss`)```. There is a custom RegEx sanitation behind the scenes. Through lots of incremental changes, we eventually arrive at an input which passes the sanitation: ```<<script><sscript>alert(`xss`)</script>```.

## Deprecated Interface
### Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down.

As has been mentioned in a few places, only pdfs are accepted in the complaint form. If we take a look, the file input accepts .pdf and .zip (expecting a zip of multiple pdfs).

![supported](/images/juice/supported.png)

When we look closer at the input element:

![deprecated](/images/juice/deprecated.png)

```
aria-label="Input area for uploading a single invoice PDF or XML B2B order file or a ZIP archive containing multiple invoices or orders<!---->"
```

it looks like it used to accept XML. So, I created a test file with ```touch test.xml``` and uploaded it which triggered the success state.

## Five-Star Feedback
### Get rid of all 5-star customer feedback.

On the ```/#/administration``` page, delete all the 5-star reviews.

### Login Admin
#### Log in with the administrator's user account.
Use SQL Injection ```' OR 1=1;--``` in email field, and any password. We can even be more explicit with ```' or 1=1 and email like('%admin%');--```.

![inject](/images/juice/sql_injection.png)


## Login MC SafeSearch
### Log in with MC SafeSearch's original user credentials without applying SQL Injection or any other bypass.
Googling MC SafeSearch we find this College Humor [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v59CX2DiX0Y).

In the song, MC SafeSearch says his password is the name of his dog Mr. Noodles, but was tricky and replaced some of the vowels with zeroes.

Email: mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op
Password: Mr. N00dles


## Password Strength
### Log in with the administrator's user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection.

If we look at the requests being made in the network tab when we navigate to ```/#/administration```, we see some interesting redacted information.

![auth_details](/images/juice/auth_details.png)

If only we could read passwords! Oh well, perhaps brute-force is in order. After the Login Admin challenge, we know the admin's email is admin@juice-sh.op. Let's go to the login form, intercept a login request, and use Burp to go through a wordlist.

Original request:

![log_req](/images/juice/log_req.png)

Send to Intruder in Burp with ```Ctrl-I```.

![attack](/images/juice/attack.png)

Get rid of the ```§```s that we don't need in the Payload Positions tab; we are only attacking the password.

```
{"email":"admin@juice-sh.op","password":"§password§"}
```

Since I have Burp Community Edition, it will take a long time for the password to be cracked. In the meantime I wrote a hydra command to do the same, faster.

```shell
$ hydra -l admin@juice-sh.op -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 127.0.0.1 http-post-form '/#/login:email=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid email or password.' -fV -s 3000 -t 1
```

The password is ```admin123```.

## Security Policy
### Behave like any "white-hat" should before getting into the action.

[security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/) is a proposed standard which allows websites to define security policies. The file is recommended to be placed inside the .well-known directory.

```shell
$ curl localhost:3000/.well-known/security.txt

## View Basket
### View another user's shopping basket.
Using FoxyProxy and Burp Suite, intercept a packet of a logged in user going to their basket. We use admin here, and from the administration page we know admin has ```1``` as their user id. We can see in the following request, that baskets are stored by user id (e.g. ```GET /rest/basket/1```).

```
To solve this challenge, simply alter ```1``` to be any other valid user id. If you are still capturing, you'll get your receipt.
```HTTP

## Weird Crypto
### Inform the shop about an algorithm or library it should definitely not use the way it does.

Mention MD5 in the comment of Customer Feedback, and the challenge is solved.
