title: Cyber Weapons Range @ Grayhat 2020
---

I took 1st place at the Cyber Weapons Range this year at Grayhat due to my speed and accuracy. Lane reservation at cyberweaponshooting.com was easy, and the Range Security Officer was professional. Thanks to everyone at Dyrwolf Inc who developed the range (and for the marksmanship badge, sticker, and certificate), and to Grayhat for hosting the challenge.
