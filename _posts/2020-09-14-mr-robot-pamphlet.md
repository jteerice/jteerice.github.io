title: eps1.91_redwheelbarr0w.txt - Prayer Pamphlet Solution
---

There is an odd pamphlet included between the pages of *eps1.91_redwheelbarr0w.txt*. After a church group meeting, Elliot found a tri-fold religious pamphlet on the desk in his cell.

**Inside**:

**Outside**:

The pamphlet is quite odd. The "comforting words" are seemingly random Bible quotes--not very comforting. So, I figured the chapter and verse numbers must not actually be random, and probably hid a message. The chapter signifies which line in the verse to look at, and the verse number identifies how many words into the verse to count. Here are the first 3 verses:

```
Proverbs 1:7
> The fear of the LORD is |the| beginning of
  knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and
  instruction

Joshua 2:5
  And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the
> gate, when it was |dark|, that the men went out:
  whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them
  quickly; for ye shall overtake them.

1 Samuel 4:2
  And the Philistines put themselves in array
  against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel
  was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of
> the |army| in the field about four thousand men.
```

I was confident this method was correct because of the mention of the Dark Army. All the others worked the same, but I grabbed two words each from Hosea 1:8-9 and Job 2:9-10.

The cleaned up final message reads:
