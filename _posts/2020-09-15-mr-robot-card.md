There is a postcard from D, likely Darlene, in between the pages of *eps1.91_redwheelbarr0w.txt*.

**Inside**:

**Outside**:

Along with the weird contents of the letter, the postscript stood out.

> P.S. I hope you got my first two letters. I sent them on the 6th.

Elliot didn't mention receiving other letters, and by itself sending two letters on the same day would be odd. I immediately thought to check the first two letters of every sixth word.

The cleaned up final message reads:
> Headquarters now established. More info once you get home. The time is close.
