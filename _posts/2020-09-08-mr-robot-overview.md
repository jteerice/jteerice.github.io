title: eps1.91_redwheelbarr0w.txt - Overview
---

I finally got around to watching *MR. ROBOT* a couple weeks ago, and I fell in love with the series. I discovered the tie-in book *eps1.91_redwheelbarr0w.txt* while searching for more content after finishing the final episode. Here's an excerpt of the description of the book:

> Before and during the events of season two, Elliot recorded his most private thoughts in this journal -- and now you can hold this piece of the series in your hands. Experience Elliot's battles to gain control of his life and his struggles to survive increasingly dangerous circumstances, in a brand-new story rendered in his own words.
> 
> The notebook also holds seven removable artifacts -- a ripped-out page, a newspaper clipping, a mysterious envelope, and more -- along with sketches throughout the book. You'll discover the story behind MR. ROBOT season two and hints of what is to come. This book is the ultimate journey into the world of the show -- and a key to hacking the mind of its main character.

I thought I'd share how I solved all the challenges I identified when reading. The ones I found were: the mysterious envelope, the QR code, the tic-tac-toe cipher, the newspaper, the multiplication table with imprint, the prayer pamphlet, and the postcard. I very well may have missed some, so send me an email if you find any others! I'd love to take a crack at them.
