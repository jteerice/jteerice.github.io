title: LocoMocoSec Secure Coding Tournament 
---

On November 5th and 6th, I attended a virtual Hawaiian Prodcut Security Conference called LocoMocoSec. Secure Code Warrior ran a Secure Coding Tournament using their platform for the conference. Having used their "Secure Code Bootcamp" mobile app and the Training tab on their portal, I felt very prepared for the competition. My preparation served me well, as I took 1st place!
